XALT: Tracking Job-level Activity on Supercomputers


Purpose:

XALT is a tool that allows supercomputer support staff to collect and
understand job-level information about the libraries and executables
that end-users access during their jobs. The tool can also work with a
system's module software to provide additional information about
module usage. 

XALT is a collaboration between PI Mark Fahey (University of Chicago,
formerly National Institute for Computational Sciences) and co-PI
Robert McLay (TACC). 


Overview:

XALT collects data by intercepting the linker (ld) and the parallel
job launcher (aprun, ibrun, mpirun, etc.).  At link time, XALT learns
the static and dynamic libraries that executable needs.  At run time
XALT determines the details of each parallel job: the name of
executable along with its dependencies, the nature of the computation
(e.g. total nodes, MPI tasks, duration, etc.), and the environment in
which the job ran. XALT writes a record of each link-time and run-time
event to a database.
