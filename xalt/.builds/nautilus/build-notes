I have uploaded XALT 0.3 to github   This is what I had planned to give
you by Thursday, so I'm ahead of the game.  Please create an account at
github.com and give it your ssh keys,  Once you send me your account
name I can add it to the XALT repo on github. This way you will be able
to push.   Here are the steps to get xalt installed:

1. git clone git@github.com:Fahey-McLay/xalt.git
2. cd xalt
3. ./configure --prefix=/opt/apps/xalt/0.3
4. make install
5. Create a module for xalt/0.3.lua:  
     prepend_path{"PATH",/opt/apps/xalt/0.3/bin, priority=100}
     prepend_path{"PYTHONPATH",/opt/apps/xalt/0.3/libexec}
     prepend_path{"PATH",/opt/apps/xalt/0.3/libexec}   # to get pstree
       [Had to modify ld to not use /usr/bin/pstree]

6. Load the xalt modulefile

Obviously you'll choose a different location than /opt/apps/xalt/0.3.
Now that xalt is installed you'll need to stand up the database and so
forth: 

1. run sbin/conf_create.py to create your own sbin/xalt_db.conf
   file to point to your MySQL server.  
2. Use sbin/createDB.py to create the initial db schema.  
3. Modify site/xalt_syshost.py to report the syshost name (darter, titan, 
   ...)  for your systems.  It will have to work on the aprun service nodes.  
4. Test the linker hijacking.   module load xalt; CC -o hello hello.c 
5. If this worked there should be a file in the ~/.xalt.d/ called
   link.darter.....json 
6. Now you get to create the aprun wrapper.   I think that the mpirun 
   wrapper should be good guide.  
7. The file site/SitePkg.py has to be modified by the site to convert 
   system names to "standard" one.  
8. Submit a job.  If this worked then there should be a 
    ~/.xalt.d/run.darter.....json file.  
9. The script sbin/xalt_json_to_db.py is supposed to read the json 
   files in ~/.xalt.d and load them into the database.   It currently 
   doesn't delete the files. but it will soon.

These are the things that I know must be done.  There may be other
things I've forgotten.   I haven't quite how to handle getting sites to
modify xalt_syshost.py  and modify site/SitePkg.py to suit.
